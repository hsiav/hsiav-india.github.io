- **Data Privacy and Security**:  
  VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, protecting you from cyberattacks, unauthorized surveillance, and potential data breaches.

- **Access Geo-Restricted Content**:  
  Unlock streaming services, websites, and apps that are regionally restricted, such as international OTT platforms or exclusive content.

- **Internet Freedom During Shutdowns**:  
  VPNs can bypass regional internet shutdowns, ensuring uninterrupted access to the web in times of need.

- **Secure Public Wi-Fi**:  
  Protect yourself from hackers and phishing attempts while using public Wi-Fi networks in cafes, airports, or malls.

## VPN Speed Comparison: Which is the Fastest for India?

Based on extensive research and multi-location testing, we’ve compiled a detailed comparison of VPN speed performance to help users make informed decisions. Among the tested VPNs, **ExpressVPN** consistently offers the highest stability, followed by **StrongVPN**, with **Surfshark** and **FlowVPN** performing comparably. The choice ultimately depends on your priorities for speed versus cost.

Below are the average speeds for these four VPNs in key regions, including India and nearby locations such as Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. We tested multiple times to account for variability and plotted error bars to indicate the standard deviation.

### Key Insight: Why Speed Matters

VPN users highly value connection speed. If a VPN significantly slows your internet, it may discourage regular use, leaving your devices unprotected. With the rise of streaming as one of the most common VPN applications, the ability to load HD and 4K content without buffering is now more critical than ever.

During our testing, we evaluated each VPN service on a 1Gbps connection, using tools like **Ookla SpeedTest**, **nPerf**, **Netflix’s Fast**, and CLI-based tools. Each tool’s results were averaged (using the median value) to ensure accuracy. Tests were repeated during both morning and evening hours to capture a representative performance range.

| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| ExpressVPN   | 600 Mbps                       | 400 Mbps |
| FlowVPN      | 650 Mbps                       | 380 Mbps |
| StrongVPN    | 500 Mbps                       | 350 Mbps |
| Surfshark    | 800 Mbps                       | 300 Mbps |

---

最近更新：`2024年12月25号`
<!-- 
>**在当前的环境下，能在国内长期稳定并有效使用的VPN服务已经变得相对稀缺。许多VPN评论网站往往互相抄袭，发布的内容很多都已经失去了时效性。有一部分推荐的VPN在国内的实际效果并不理想，令人遗憾的是，很多的评论者身处国外，他们并无法提供在国内使用VPN的真实体验。特别是在过去的两年中，由于"防火长城"的严密封锁，许多过去可用的VPN现在已经变得几乎无法使用。因此，在阅读本文的同时，我建议大家需要谨慎理解并避免进入"坑"。本文将根据实际的使用经验介绍各种VPN软件的最新使用情况，并将持续更新最新的使用情况，以供大家参考和避坑。本文是关于中国安全翻牆策略的详细版本，讨论了翻牆软件、科学上网以及网络安全等相关问题。如果你只希望快速选择一款科学上网软件来翻牆，那麽可以直接查看本文下方的目录导航。

翻牆（科学上网）的重要性，我想大家心里都有数。否则，你现在也不会在这里阅读这篇文章。如果不能翻牆，就不能使用Google搜寻编程代码，不能回复Gmail邮件，也无法观看YouTube的视频。那些在Udemy购买的课程，你能够舒适地观看吗？你能否追踪HBO和Netflix的剧集？由于工作出差和生活学习的需要，我经常需要在不同的地区使用科学上网。基于我的个人使用感受以及对VPN软件这个行业的理解，我将为读者推荐在国内最好用、最稳定和最安全的科学上网方法和工具。我也将长期关注VPN、SSR、WireGuard、V2Ray、蓝灯等翻牆和信息安全技术。

>**据中央社引述中国官方消息报道，中国上网人数突破9亿，网购用户超过7亿，可见大家对上网的需求日益增加, 有鉴于网路上许多博主到处乱推荐VPN，都推荐一堆不能用的，不能用的就算了，还要骗大家去买来拿钱，这类博客有个特点，就是喜欢自己架一个网站，写一堆话来骗大家，近几年来，防火墙更新越来越强大，过去许多VPN已经完全不能使用。为了让大家能够持续的有知的自由，再加上太多网站喜欢说不实的讯息，我决定在github上建造一个网页，作为自由博客，帮助大家避坑，不要再浪费时间在那些危险的VPN或是不能用的VPN上。本文会介绍细节，讲一些技术，只想看翻墙科学软件推荐的朋友(如果只想快速选个科学上网软件来翻墙)，可以直接看我的推荐栏位。

多年中美工作经验告诉我，翻墙几乎是现代人必备的一个技能，由于言论审查，只要翻不了墙就不能Google学新的东西，不翻墙就不能看YouTube视频，用facebook，line和外国朋友联络，Coursera和Udemy等线上课程都不能好好观看。HBO、Netflix等影视娱乐也必须要翻墙才能观看，BBC,CNN等国际新闻也都必须要借由翻墙才观看。我本人由于跨国工作，经常要在不同地区使用科学上网，我本人自己也是网路程序员，博士是研究机器学习，也研究过网路相关问题，我将会在下面详细介绍VPN、SSR、WireGuard、V2Ray、Trojan等翻墙和信息安全技术和基本加密技术，我也将就自己的使用感受和对翻墙软件的了解，自己进行数值实验和速度测试，为读者推荐在国内最好用、稳定和安全的科学上网方法和工具。

## 最新本月翻墙新闻更新
微软在2024年6月发布的最新安全更新可能导致Windows用户的VPN连接出现问题。受影响的操作系统包括Windows 11、Windows 10以及Windows Server 2008及以上版本。部分用户在Reddit上反映更新后无法连接VPN，尽管有些用户通过重新安装VPN应用暂时解决了问题。微软已确认此问题，并表示将在未来的更新中修复。这一情况与微软CEO Satya Nadella强调的安全优先的立场形成了对比。

## 翻牆近况更新
**从2021年的圣诞季节到2023年五月的春末，这一段缤纷却又多事的时光，我们在VPN的世界里看到了许多变化。**那些曾经的大腕如Ivacy、VyprVPN、和蓝灯，在中国的市场里屡遭挫折，似乎正如那浓烈的火锅汤底对于胃的挑战一样，它们的伺服器经常遭受封锁。特别是蓝灯，其安全性就像那灯下的虫子，暴露在我们的目光之下。在此，我们要对所有的用户喊话，请注意躲避这些隐患。那些曾经坚固的城堡如NordVPN，在这场风暴中也是被重点打击，现在可以说是倒下的巨人，它的表现就像一个突然失去了方向的孩子，常常需要手动配置。那个我们曾经称之为“小明星”的PIA，在这场狂风中失去了光芒，被封锁后一直无法有后续的有效反击，目前在国内还是无法连接，请大家谨慎选择。

神秘的PandaVPN就像是一个离家出走的孩子，从11月的深秋开始，就像那渐渐落叶的树一样，官网无法访问，线路无法连接，即使呼喊，也无人回应，我们怀疑他可能已经选择了别的路，去寻找自己的世界，选择了卷款跑路。很多专为国人服务的翻牆软件都在走这条路，大家需要提高警惕，毕竟，世界是美好的，也是充满了挑战。

然而，就像那永不消逝的北斗星，**只有ExpressVPN和StrongVPN在过去几年的表现一直保持着稳定，就如同坐在海边听着浪潮的声音一样令人放心。ExpressVPN像是我们的瑞士刀，适用于所有平台，使用体验就像是骑在风中自由的马上，即使遭遇到封锁，它也能在一周内恢復，只要更新了程序，就像是喝了神奇药剂一样，官方推荐的线路就能恢復正常连接。StrongVPN则是我们的轻装步兵，价格相对便宜，拥有通用版客户端和特供的简化版客户端可供使用，无论是Windows、Mac还是安卓手机端，都能适应。**它们的伺服器线路就像是快速的马车，不时会更新，过去的两年里被封锁的次数也相对较少。但是如果你是iPhone的用户，使用StrongVPN可能需要像是打开一道神秘的门一样，联繫客服手动配置翻牆。而在这种敏感的时期，如果遇到连接问题，你可能需要像是找到藏宝图一样，联繫客服提供国内可用线路或备用线路。

## Understanding VPNs for Internet Freedom in India

### What is a VPN?

A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a tool that helps users protect their online privacy, bypass geo-restrictions, and access the full potential of the internet securely. While countries like China have strict internet censorship policies enforced through their "Great Firewall," India faces a different set of challenges when it comes to digital freedom.

---

### Internet Challenges in India: Why Use a VPN?

India does not have a centralized firewall like China, but there are significant reasons why VPNs are becoming increasingly essential for Indian users:

#### **1. Protecting Your Privacy**
India has seen growing concerns over online privacy due to government surveillance and data retention policies. VPNs can encrypt your online activities, ensuring that your browsing history and personal data are safe from prying eyes, including your ISP or malicious actors.

#### **2. Accessing Geo-Restricted Content**
Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ often restrict certain content to specific regions. VPNs allow Indian users to access a broader range of global entertainment by connecting to servers in other countries, bypassing these regional restrictions.

#### **3. Avoiding Bandwidth Throttling**
Some ISPs in India throttle bandwidth for certain applications, such as streaming or gaming. A VPN masks your online activity, preventing ISPs from selectively slowing down your connection.

#### **4. Maintaining Internet Access During Shutdowns**
India has seen an increasing number of internet shutdowns in specific regions due to political unrest or security concerns. VPNs can help users maintain access to the internet during such disruptions, providing a vital lifeline for communication and work.

---

### VPNs and Internet Freedom: A Broader Perspective

While the need for VPNs in India differs from countries with heavy censorship, the underlying goal remains the same—ensuring digital freedom and security. By routing your traffic through encrypted servers, a VPN can help you bypass government-imposed restrictions, access blocked websites, and protect your personal information.

---

### Why Are VPNs So Popular in India?

The demand for VPNs in India has surged due to a combination of factors:

1. **Increased Work-from-Home Requirements**: With many Indians working remotely, accessing secure connections for tools like Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom has become critical.
2. **Growing Concerns About Online Safety**: Cyberattacks and data breaches have become more frequent, making VPNs a necessity for protecting sensitive information.
3. **Streaming and Gaming**: The need for high-speed, unrestricted access to global streaming services and gaming platforms has driven the adoption of VPNs among younger users.

---

### How Does a VPN Work?

A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server. This process masks your IP address, making it appear as though you are browsing from the server's location. For Indian users, this means:
- **Enhanced Privacy**: ISPs and government entities cannot monitor your online activities.
- **Seamless Access to Global Content**: Enjoy streaming, gaming, and browsing without worrying about restrictions or throttling.

---

### VPN Terminology in India

While terms like "bypassing censorship" or "breaking restrictions" may not be as commonly used in India as in countries with strict internet controls, Indian users often refer to VPNs for:
- **Streaming Freedom**: Unlocking content on platforms like Netflix, Hulu, or Disney+.
- **Secure Browsing**: Ensuring privacy on public Wi-Fi.
- **Uninterrupted Internet**: Maintaining access during regional internet disruptions.

---



### Benefits of Using a VPN: Why Should You Hide Your IP Address?

Your IP address is like a digital street address. It uniquely identifies your location and device on the internet. However, this identification can sometimes work against you—third parties can use it to monitor your activities or track your whereabouts. 

By replacing your IP address with that of a VPN server, VPN providers encrypt your connection and hide your true online identity within seconds. This creates a private and secure network where your internet traffic is fully shielded from third parties. Whether you're concerned about online privacy, security, or anonymity, a VPN provides the protection you need in today’s digital landscape.

---

### Public Wi-Fi Risks: How a VPN Protects You

Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in cafes, airports, and hotels, are convenient but inherently risky. These busy hotspots expose your data to hackers and malicious actors. Without a VPN, using public Wi-Fi puts you at risk of data breaches, including the compromise of:
- Banking and financial information
- Work-related communications
- Phone numbers, emails, and personal messages

When connected to a VPN, your internet activity is encrypted and routed through a secure network, ensuring that even on unsecured Wi-Fi networks, your data remains safe. Whether you're streaming, shopping, or working remotely, a VPN allows you to use public Wi-Fi with peace of mind.

---

### Key VPN Protocols to Know

Understanding the following VPN-related terms will help you make an informed decision when choosing a VPN service. These protocols are the backbone of how VPNs function, offering varying levels of security, speed, and reliability:

- **WireGuard**: A modern VPN protocol known for its speed and efficiency. Ideal for streaming and gaming.
- **OpenVPN**: A versatile and widely used protocol offering strong encryption. Great for general security needs.
- **IKEv2/IPSec**: Known for its stability on mobile devices, this protocol is perfect for users who switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data.

---

### Features to Look for in the Best VPNs for India

Based on extensive testing and user feedback, here are the essential features that make a VPN truly stand out for Indian users:

1. **High Security**: Ensure the VPN provider is not based in jurisdictions with poor privacy laws. Non-Indian providers are often preferred for better data privacy.
2. **Stable Connection**: A reliable VPN should maintain consistent performance across various networks.
3. **Fast Speeds**: A high-speed connection is crucial for activities like streaming and gaming.
4. **Multiple Server Locations**: Access to servers in a variety of countries ensures better performance and access to geo-restricted content.
5. **Ease of Use**: A user-friendly interface with one-click connection simplifies the process.
6. **Strong Encryption**: Advanced encryption protocols keep your data secure.
7. **Multi-Device Support**: Look for VPNs that allow simultaneous connections on multiple devices.
8. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the VPN works seamlessly across Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and other operating systems.
9. **24/7 Customer Support**: Responsive support is essential, preferably in English or regional languages.
10. **Money-Back Guarantee**: A 30-day refund policy allows you to test the service risk-free.
11. **Flexible Payment Options**: Support for local payment methods like UPI, Paytm, or international cards.
12. **Affordable Pricing**: Ensure the VPN offers good value for money, balancing cost with features.

---

### Selecting the Best VPNs for India: Practical Recommendations

After testing hundreds of VPNs, the following factors were identified as the most critical for Indian users:
- **Privacy Protection**: Choose a VPN provider with a strict no-logs policy and robust encryption.
- **Unrestricted Streaming**: Look for services that excel at bypassing geo-restrictions on platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video.
- **Public Wi-Fi Safety**: Ensure your VPN has features to protect against risks on unsecured networks.
- **Global Server Access**: A diverse server network is key for accessing region-specific content and ensuring a lag-free connection.

## VPN Challenges in India During Sensitive Periods
<a name="India-VPN-Challenges"></a>

### What Are "Sensitive Periods" in India?

In India, "sensitive periods" refer to times when internet restrictions or disruptions occur due to political, social, or international events. These disruptions may include throttling, blocking specific websites, or complete shutdowns in certain regions. Such measures are often implemented to maintain security, but they can pose significant challenges for internet users, including those relying on VPNs.

During these periods, accessing even non-restricted websites can become difficult, as internet speeds drop or connections become unstable. While premium VPN providers like **ExpressVPN** and **Surfshark** often adapt quickly to such scenarios, less robust services may struggle to maintain functionality.

---

### Common Scenarios Leading to Internet Restrictions

#### **1. During Major National Events**
Internet restrictions are frequently imposed during significant national events, such as elections or high-profile government meetings. These measures may include:
- **Slower Speeds**: Even top-tier VPNs may experience reduced performance.
- **Blocked Servers**: Access to certain VPN servers might be restricted. Switching to protocols like **OpenVPN** or **WireGuard** can help in some cases.
- **Increased Surveillance**: Online activity might be monitored more closely, emphasizing the importance of VPN encryption.

#### **2. Regional Shutdowns**
India has seen numerous regional internet shutdowns during protests, communal tensions, or law enforcement operations. These shutdowns are often temporary but can severely disrupt communication and access to information. VPNs can sometimes bypass localized restrictions, but their effectiveness depends on the severity of the shutdown.

#### **3. Black Swan Events**
Unexpected global or national crises—such as the COVID-19 pandemic or international conflicts—can lead to heightened internet restrictions. These may include blocking international news outlets or social media platforms to prevent misinformation. During such times, premium VPNs like **StrongVPN** or **Surfshark** are invaluable for maintaining access to essential online resources.

---

### How to Stay Connected During Sensitive Periods

1. **Use Premium VPNs**: Services like **ExpressVPN** and **Surfshark** offer advanced protocols and robust server networks to handle restrictions.
2. **Switch Protocols**: Protocols like **WireGuard** or **OpenVPN** are more resilient to throttling and blocking.
3. **Stay Updated**: Monitor updates from your VPN provider, as they may roll out temporary fixes or alternative server options during disruptions.
4. **Prepare in Advance**: Download and configure VPN apps before restrictions are expected, ensuring you have access when you need it most.

---

### Regional Observations

#### **1. Internet Restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir**
Frequent and prolonged shutdowns have been reported in this region due to security concerns. VPNs are often the only way for residents to access vital services and information.

#### **2. Restrictions During Protests**
Major protests, such as the farmer protests in 2020-2021, led to localized internet shutdowns. VPNs helped many users stay connected, although speeds were often throttled.

#### **3. Internet Blackouts During Exams**
To prevent cheating during national or state-level exams, authorities have occasionally shut down internet access in specific regions. VPNs are generally ineffective in complete blackouts but may help bypass restrictions in less severe cases.

---

### Choosing the Right VPN for India

In challenging times, not all VPNs are created equal. Here are some recommendations:
- **ExpressVPN**: Known for its fast speeds and reliable connections, even during disruptions.
- **Surfshark**: Offers affordable plans with unlimited device connections and robust encryption.
- **StrongVPN**: A solid choice for bypassing regional restrictions with multiple protocol options.

For detailed comparisons and setup guides, refer to our VPN recommendations below.

### Why Not Set Up Your Own VPN Server?

You may consider setting up your own VPN server for better control, privacy, or accessing geo-restricted content. However, we strongly discourage this approach for the following reasons:

1. **High Costs**: Building your own VPN requires substantial investment in hardware, software, and a reliable internet connection. The ongoing maintenance costs can add up quickly.

2. **Time-Consuming**: Setting up and maintaining a VPN server is a complex task requiring significant technical expertise and ongoing updates.

3. **Security Risks**: Without the right security measures, your VPN server could be vulnerable to malware, data breaches, or unauthorized access.

For these reasons, using a reputable commercial VPN service is often a better and safer alternative.

---

### Why Avoid Creating a VPN on Your Own Computer?

Setting up a VPN on your personal computer may seem like an easy solution, but it comes with several drawbacks:

1. **Technical Complexity**: While open-source protocols like **WireGuard**, **OpenVPN**, or other custom configurations are available, they require technical knowledge to implement securely. Misconfiguration can expose your system to vulnerabilities.

2. **High Maintenance**: Running a VPN server on your computer requires keeping your system online 24/7. Additionally, you'll need to stay ahead of security updates and adapt to potential changes in blocking techniques.

3. **Legal and Privacy Concerns**: Depending on your jurisdiction, hosting a VPN server may attract unwanted attention or legal complications. Sharing your VPN setup with others could also pose risks.

Instead, opt for reliable VPN providers that offer robust security and regular updates.

---

### Avoid Using Cracked Software

Using cracked or pirated VPN software is not recommended due to several reasons:

1. **Unreliable and Buggy**: Cracked software often lacks stability and proper updates, leading to frequent crashes and poor performance.
   
2. **Lack of Support**: Unlike official versions, cracked software doesn’t come with customer support or security assurances.

3. **High Security Risks**: Cracked software can expose your system to viruses, malware, and data breaches, putting your personal information at risk.

4. **Fraudulent Sources**: Many cracked software distributors operate scams, promising free access but delivering subpar or malicious products.

Invest in legitimate VPN solutions or explore free, trustworthy alternatives.

---

### Recommendations for VPNs in India

Based on personal experience, using a **paid VPN** is the best choice for most users. Paid VPNs typically provide:
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, etc.).
- Integration of advanced protocols like **WireGuard**, **Trojan**, and **OpenVPN**, ensuring high security and performance.
- Regular updates and active customer support.

#### Why Avoid Free VPNs?
While free VPNs may seem attractive, they come with significant risks:
1. **Unstable Connections**: Free VPNs often struggle to maintain reliable connections.
2. **Malware Risks**: Some free VPNs include mining malware or trackers that compromise your privacy.
3. **Limited Features**: Bandwidth restrictions, fewer servers, and poor performance are common with free services.

Instead, choose reputable paid VPN providers like **ExpressVPN**, **Surfshark**, or **StrongVPN** for a secure and seamless experience. These providers offer:
- Affordable long-term plans.
- Strong encryption and privacy policies.
- Broad compatibility across devices.


## India VPN Blacklist: Services to Avoid
<a name="India-VPN-Blacklist-Services-to-Avoid"></a>

When choosing a VPN for India, it's essential to steer clear of services that fail to meet performance or privacy expectations. Below are VPN services that have been tested and are either ineffective or unsuitable for use in India due to various limitations:

---

### ProtonVPN

ProtonVPN was a popular choice globally until recent years, but it struggles in regions with high levels of censorship or advanced network restrictions. Its performance in India has shown significant connectivity issues, and its support for bypassing geoblocks is minimal. Even its official website acknowledges limitations in restricted regions.

<img src="./image/black/proton.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

---

### AstrillVPN

AstrillVPN is among the most expensive VPNs on the market, with plans starting at $10 per month. Compared to more affordable options like **StrongVPN** ($3/month) or **Surfshark** ($2.50/month for 2-year plans), AstrillVPN offers poor value for money. Despite its high price tag, it lacks consistency in unblocking streaming services like Hulu and Netflix and has a strict no-refund policy, making it a risky investment.

<img src="./image/black/astrillvpn.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

---

### NordVPN

NordVPN, though globally recognized and praised for its security, faces challenges in India. The service has connectivity issues due to stricter regulations and its inability to adapt to evolving restrictions. While it offers robust privacy policies, its technical limitations in highly censored environments like India make it less effective than alternatives like ExpressVPN.

---

### VyprVPN

VyprVPN, while previously a strong contender in the VPN market, has shown inconsistent performance in India. Speed and reliability have dropped significantly over the years. However, VyprVPN remains a reasonable option for accessing certain Indian content from abroad, thanks to its dedicated Indian servers.

---

### IVacy Enhanced Edition

Despite IVacy VPN’s claim to provide extensive server options globally, its performance in India remains underwhelming. Recent speed tests in May 2023 revealed poor connectivity and unstable speeds. While it boasts features like military-grade encryption and 24/7 support, its practicality in India is questionable.

---

### PureVPN: A Mixed Bag

PureVPN is one of the older VPN providers, founded in 2006, but its performance in India has been mediocre. While it supports major platforms and offers affordable pricing, its server availability and connectivity during peak times in India are lacking. PureVPN also removed servers in Indian cities like Mumbai and Delhi, reducing its appeal to users seeking localized content access.

#### Key Limitations:
- Poor connection stability.
- Suboptimal speeds for streaming.
- Limited success in bypassing Indian network restrictions.

Despite its claims of privacy protection, PureVPN’s reliability issues make it less ideal compared to competitors like Surfshark or ExpressVPN.

---

### Key Takeaways

When selecting a VPN for India:
1. Avoid services like ProtonVPN, AstrillVPN, and PureVPN, as they lack the performance and reliability necessary for bypassing restrictions effectively.
2. Opt for trusted providers like **ExpressVPN** or **StrongVPN**, which are proven to perform well in India.
3. Always test the VPN during the trial period and consider refund policies before committing to a subscription.

With the right VPN, you can enjoy secure, unrestricted internet access tailored to your needs in India.

## 中国VPN推荐标准以及必要的特色
<a name="中国VPN推荐标准以及必要的特色"></a>
在选择 VPN 服务时，以下是一些重要的考虑因素：

### 1. 稳定可靠的大品牌
随着我国政策的日益严格和“墙”的不断升高，一些常见的 VPN 流量，如过去的 PPTP 协议，现在已经容易被识别和封锁。此外，一旦某些 IP 被大规模发现有特征流量，这些 IP 基本上就不能再使用了。这也是自建 SSR 存在的问题，一旦 IP 被封，通常需要付费购买新的 IP。

因此，选择一个稳定可靠的大品牌 VPN 非常重要。这需要 VPN 服务商有强大的资金和技术支持，才能应对“墙”的不断升级和迭代，长期保持 VPN 服务的稳定和可靠。

### 2. 个人测试和使用
本文推荐的 VPN 服务都是全球排名前 20 的大品牌，都经过了我个人的使用和测试。这与许多其他的推荐不同，那些推荐可能是没有实际测试和使用过，或者包含了很多过期的信息。例如，有些 VPN 品牌可能已经倒闭（比如 Green 等国产品牌），或者以前在国内能用，现在却不能用了。

我个人也是经常几家换着用，最少要做两手准备，以防在墙外出现尴尬的情况。

我们的 VPN 推荐是基于上述的选择标准，建议大家在选择 VPN 时，参考这些标准和我们的 VPN 排名，以及我分享的最新使用信息，而不是盲目付费购买。


### 1 各种操作系统均支持
如果你运行的是 Windows 或 macOS，多数人不必担心这个问题。大多数VPN还具有适用于Android和iOS的移动应用程序。 但是，如果你运行的是Linux或其各种特别的发行版，例如 Ubuntu，则情况并非如此。大多数VPN仅提供适用于 Linux 的命令行应用程序，而Expressvpn 和strongvpn 是少数具有完整 Linux 应用程序的 VPN 之一。

### 2 多少设备同时连接
Expressvpn，StrongVPN，flowvpn，最多允许五种设备连结，surfshark则可以允许无限多台设备连接，这里要记住的一件事是，这只是你可以同时连接的设备数量。你仍然可以在无限多的设备上安装和运行 Expressvpn，StrongVPN，flowvpn 等服务——你只是无法同时在所有设备上运行 VPN。

### 3 拆分隧道技巧
拆分隧道(英文称作VPN split tunneling)，简单说就是: 拆分隧道允许您选择哪些应用程序将通过VPN运行，哪些应用程序将不受保护。比方我在国内一个浏览器听爱奇异，另一个浏览器在看IEEE的文章(研究生的日常)，爱奇异就不需要通过VPN，IEEE则需要通过VPN，这样让你的平均速度的最大化。通常当你运行VPN时候，local端的速度会降低，因为中间的传输VPN加密需要时间。隧道拆芬可以部份解决这个问题。

### 4 带宽(bandwidth)
这是一个经常被误解的主题，很多博主搞不清楚带宽限制和数据限制的差别。带宽决定了你一次可以传输多少数据。简单说，你拥有的带宽越多，你可以传输的视频质量就越高。拥有无限带宽意味着连接到 VPN的其他人不会影响你的速度。再举个例子: 另一方面，数据限制决定了你在特定时间段内可以使用的流量。例如，如果你的每日数据流量限制为10GB，您可以观看两到三部高清电影，或下载 10GB 的文件。

### 5 七天24小时 客户支持
通常有两种方法，ExpressVPN 等高级VPN提供商提供聊天(online chat)作为主要支持形式。更多大多数提供商允许你直接通过电子邮件沟通，strongvpn 和expressvpn都有即时聊天系统。

### 6 30天内退款保证
如果你对为你购买的VPN犹豫不决，你会很高兴听到大多数 VPN 提供30天内退款保证



## VPN 隐私功能
### 7 无日誌政策
无日志政策几乎是VPN必要条件，简单说: 他永远不会记录或存储您的数据。但是，除了检查VPN提供商的历史记录是没有什么好方法可以知道哪些提供商会真正的清除用户的纪录。过去有不少VPN号称无纪录，但是后面被发现 偷偷的贩售使用者资料，这类VPN，我有整理在下方。大家千万不要使用。

### 8 多元付款方式 
包含 信用卡，master card, visa card。paypal。支付保alipay，ExpressVPN甚至允许你使用比特币等加密货币进行支付。

### 9 安全性高: 使用最新的加密系统
加密的原理需要用到很多数学，这裡不在详述，VPN使用加密协议对您的数据进行加扰，并使用加密密钥确保其安全。你很可能会看到以字母和数字组合命名的加密类型，例如 AES-256、RSA-4096。这都是不同的加密演算法，牵涉到很多代数相关的问题，简单说 数字越大，加密协议越安全。

### 10 各种VPN协议
在VPN裡面，有各种协议，PPTP vs. OpenVPN vs. L2TP/IPsec vs. SSTP各种协议。每种协议针对不同设备跟用途各有优劣，这裡不再做详述

### 11 VPN自动化的功能
VPN现在会自动执行VPN连接，因此你不会意外连接到不受保护的互联网。例如，你可以选择连接到离你最近的服务器，或你最后连接的位置。但并非所有VPN服务都提供相同的自动化功能。

### 12 VPN终止开关
VPN终止开关是另一个自动化功能，如今几乎是标准的VPN功能。如果你的VPN由于某种原因停止工作，它会自动切断你的互联网连接。这可确保你始终受到安全VPN连接的保护，即使VPN突然连接中断，你也会马上离开互联网。保障你的安全

## VPN服务器的分析-使用小秘诀
<a name="VPN服务器的分析-使用小秘诀"></a>
VPN服务器的分布，也是一个很VPN效能的关键因素，第一: 服务器的数量当然重要，但更重要的是它们的分布方式以及它们复盖的国家/地区。你离VPN服务器越近，连接速度就越快。

### 如何解决VPN连接中断的问题
<a name="如何解决VPN连接中断的问题"></a>

使用VPN（Virtual Private Network）时，连接中断是一个常见的问题。这可能由多种原因导致，例如网络质量不佳，服务器过载，甚至是防火墙的干扰。不论原因如何，这都是一个令人沮丧的问题，尤其是当你正在进行重要的工作或看你最喜欢的节目时。但是，有一些有效的策略可以帮助你解决这个问题：

#### 1. 更换VPN服务器

有时候，VPN连接中断的问题可能是由于你正在连接的服务器过载或质量不佳。在这种情况下，更换到另一个服务器可能是一个快速有效的解决方案。大多数VPN服务都提供多个服务器供用户选择，你可以试试看是否有其他服务器可以提供更稳定的连接。

#### 2. 检查网络连接

如果你的互联网连接本身就存在问题，那么VPN服务可能无法正常工作。在这种情况下，你需要解决网络连接问题，例如，尝试重启路由器，或者与你的互联网服务提供商联系。

#### 3. 切换VPN协议

大多数VPN服务都支持多种VPN协议，例如OpenVPN，PPTP，L2TP/IPsec等。这些协议在速度，安全性和稳定性上有所不同。如果你经常遇到连接中断的问题，你可以试试看切换到其他的VPN协议。

#### 4. 使用网络连接监控功能

一些高级的VPN服务提供了网络连接监控（Network Lock）或者叫做断网杀开关的功能。这个功能能够在你的VPN连接突然中断时立即停止所有的网络流量，以防止你的数据被泄露。当你的VPN连接恢复后，网络流量就会自动恢复。

在解决VPN连接中断的问题时，关键在于找到问题的根源。这可能需要一些时间和耐心，但是一旦你找到了解决方案，你就可以享受到无中断的VPN服务。

### 如何确保你的VPN一直开启并正常运行
<a name="如何确保你的VPN一直开启并正常运行"></a>

确保VPN一直开启并正常运行对于保持连续的网络安全和隐私至关重要。以下是一些策略和建议：

#### 1. 选择一个稳定的VPN服务

并非所有的VPN服务提供商都一样，一些服务提供商可能比其他服务更稳定，有更好的客户支持，或者有更强的基础设施。在选择VPN服务时，务必做好调查，并根据你的需求和预算选择最适合你的服务。

#### 2. 使用自动启动功能

大多数VPN应用都有自动启动功能，这意味着当你启动设备时，VPN会自动连接。这可以帮助确保你的VPN一直开启。

#### 3. 使用杀开关（Kill Switch）功能

杀开关是一种特殊的VPN功能，当你的VPN连接意外中断时，它会立即断开你的互联网连接，防止你的数据在未加密的状态下传输。当VPN重新连接后，互联网连接也会自动恢复。

#### 4. 定期检查VPN连接

虽然大多数VPN应用会在连接中断时提供通知，但还是有一些可能不会。你可以定期检查你的VPN状态，或者使用一些第三方工具来监控你的VPN连接。

#### 5. 确保你的设备和应用程序保持最新

过时的操作系统和应用程序可能会影响VPN的性能和稳定性。确保你的设备和VPN应用都保持最新，可以帮助你防止这种问题。

#### 6. 选择正确的VPN协议

不同的VPN协议在稳定性，安全性和速度方面有所不同。在网络环境不稳定或者速度较慢的情况下，使用更稳定或更快的协议可能有助于保持VPN的连续连接。

每个人的情况和需求可能会有所不同，你可能需要根据自己的具体情况调整这些策略。在任何情况下，保持你的VPN一直开启并正常运行都是保护你的网络安全和隐私的重要步骤。


### 实体vs虚拟服务器
实体服务器是存在于现实世界中的硬件(硬体速度比软体快)。它在帮助提供商端运行VPN软件，当你使用VPN时，它就是您连接和发送流量的工具。实体服务器（在大多数情况下）比虚拟服务器更快。虚拟服务器是在实体服务器上运行的模拟服务器，可能位于不同的位置。ExpressVPN使用一些虚拟服务器为他们的用户提供他们无法操作的国家/地区的访问权限。例如，如果某个国家/地区已禁止 VPN(像是中国)，或者如果在那里建立硬体服务器在经济上不可行(非洲国家)，则VPN可以使用虚拟服务器来提供对该位置的访问。

### 媒体服务器 
媒体服务器是针对带宽密集型任务（通常是多媒体影音平台）来进行优化的服务器。并非所有服务器的构建方式都相同，由于位于高流量位置，某些服务器的容量可能会降低。媒体服务器应该（理论上）为繁重的任务提供更好的连接，并隐藏你正在使用VPN的事实，因此媒体网站不会阻止你。

### P2P服务器
P2P（或“点对点”）网络是您可以直接从其他用户的计算机下载文件的地方，而不是集中式服务器。特别适合torrent的下载如，果您打算使用 VPN 进行种子下载，那么使用专用服务器总是有帮助的。除了额外的带宽容量，这些P2P服务器还提供额外的安全措施。


## 在中国使用VPN常见的问题
底下是网友常常问问的部分问题，我将它稍微整理如下:

### 我购买的strong VPN突然不能连线，要如何处理: 
strongvpn 是目前最受欢迎的 VPN 提供商之一，但这并不意味着它是完美的。 用户体验的一个常见问题是 strongvpn 丢失连接。 这可能会令人沮丧，尤其是当你正在将 VPN 用于重要的事情时。 发生这种情况的原因有几个。 首先，strongvpn 可能在您所在的地区遇到中断。 其次，您的互联网连接可能不稳定。 第三，您可能超出了计划的数据限制。 第四，您连接的服务器可能正在经历大量流量。 如果您遇到 strongvpn 丢失连接，您应该做的第一件事是检查您所在地区是否存在任何已知问题。 如果没有，请尝试重新启动路由器和 strongvpn 客户端。 如果这不起作用，请联系客户支持以帮助解决问题。


### 如果您在尝试购买 StrongVPN 时收到“检测到可疑活动，请联系支持”消息 (Suspicious activity detected, please contact the support.)
如果您在尝试购买 StrongVPN 时收到“检测到可疑活动，请联系支持”消息，则可能是您使用的公共代理 IP 或邮箱有问题。我们建议尝试其他机会或联系客户服务寻求帮助。联系客户服务时，请务必提供与您合作的代理的 IP 地址，以便他们调查问题并尽快帮助解决问题。

### 防火牆升级导致expressvpn，不能连线，怎麽处理。
ExpressVPN 是一种虚拟专用网络服务，允许用户以更高的隐私和安全性连接到互联网。 但是，升级墙后，ExpressVPN无法连接。 这是因为墙的例行升级导致ExpressVPN的几个常用节点突然无法连接。 但别担心，有一个解决方案。 用户可以尝试连接手机上的其他节点，也可以尝试使用L2TP协议连接其他节点。 使用 ExpressVPN，用户将能够以更高的隐私和安全性享受互联网。


### 防火牆升级导致surfshark，不能连线，怎麽处理。
Surfshack 提供了一种专用的智能上网模式，可自动将您连接到最佳位置的最快服务器。 这使其成为想要在海外访问相关内容或网站的任何人的理想选择。 然而，Surfshack 的一个缺点是它偶尔会失去连接。 这可能令人沮丧，但您可以采取一些措施来解决此问题。 首先，确保您使用的是最新版本的 Surfshack 应用程序。 其次，检查您的互联网连接并确保其稳定。 最后，如果一切都失败了，您可以尝试连接到不同的 Surfshack 服务器。 按照这些步骤，您应该能够成功连接到 Surfshack 并享受它的所有好处。

### 经过15个月以后，我想要再用优惠代码购买expressvpn? 是否可以?
如果您希望续订 ExpressVPN 订阅，可以通过此页面上的折扣链接进行。 只需使用新的电子邮件地址创建一个新帐户，您就有资格获得三个月的免费。 然后，您可以直接从 ExpressVPN 网站续订旧帐户或购买新订阅。 请记住，年度续订旧帐户没有折扣，因此如果您走这条路线，则必须支付全价。

其他VPN续费方法与此相同。 大多数品牌为新帐户提供折扣，因此在注册新帐户之前清除浏览器 cookie 或使用 VPN 非常重要。 这将帮助您避免被系统视为重复注册。 续订订阅时，请务必检查可能提供的任何特别优惠或交易。 您通常可以在品牌网站上或通过搜索引擎找到这些优惠。 如果您通过第三方提供商续订订阅，请务必询问他们是否提供任何折扣。 很多时候，通过第三方提供商续订订阅可以为您省钱。

### 使用expressVPN或strongvpn 连接后，访问国内网站慢或者无法访问，
对于那些寻求可靠且价格合理的 VPN 服务的人来说，StrongVPN 或expressvpn 是一个不错的选择。然而，SStrongVPN 或expressvpn的一个缺点是它是一个全球代理。这意味着连接后，你的数据会先发送到国外服务器，然后再传回给你。这可能会显着增加你的连接延迟，并使网页浏览或流式视频非常缓慢。一种解决方案是在你的计算机上安装虚拟机并使用它来访问 StrongVPN。通过这样做，你可以完全避免延迟问题。此外，StrongVPN 经常提供续订折扣，因此值得经常查看他们的网站以获得最优惠的价格。

部分电脑读者也主要遇到strongVPN的外网连接问题（我自己用的时候遇到过这样的问题，但是重新连接就好了，如果一直无法上网，请咨询官网） 回复来自客服是： 本地网络操作 商用DNS有限制，可能需要修改DNS服务器。比如改成114DNS或者阿里云DNS就可以解决这个问题。修改DNS服务器：打开Strong VPN客户端——点击设置——点击高级——选择“使用自定义DNS服务器”——第一行DNS服务器地址输入8.8.8.8——第二行输入8.8.4 4输入DNS服务器地址（或其他可以连接的公网DNS服务器）-save-restart strong vpn-retry connection

如果仍然无法解决，可能与您的路由器设置或你的 ISP 限制有关。您可以尝试以下解决方案：

1) 在路由器上为 UDP 500 和 UDP 4500 配置端口转发；
2) 在您的路由器上启用 OpenVPN/IPSec 直通；
3) 设置您计算机的防火墙以允许来自 Strong 的所有流量

### Core Knowledge You Must Know About VPNs
<a name="core-vpn-knowledge"></a>

#### What is the Basic Principle of a VPN?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your data through complex mathematical algorithms, creating a secure "tunnel" between your device and the internet. This ensures that others cannot view your data. VPNs hide metadata sent by your browser, such as time zone, operating system, and even screen resolution. While this data might not directly identify you, it can uniquely fingerprint your activity, which governments, advertisers, and hackers might exploit. This is why a VPN is essential for privacy and security.

#### What is the Great Firewall of China?

China's "Great Firewall" is a comprehensive censorship system managed by the Ministry of Public Security. It monitors and restricts internet content that can be accessed within the country. Started in 1998, it employs techniques like IP blocking and URL filtering. For instance, platforms like Google, Facebook, and Twitter are blocked in China to prevent the rapid dissemination of information. This stringent censorship highlights the need for tools like VPNs to access restricted content.

#### What Can a VPN Do?

VPNs can mask your IP address, making it appear as though you're browsing from a different location. This opens up possibilities such as:

- **Unlocking Streaming Platforms**: Access content libraries from different countries on platforms like Netflix.
- **Bypassing Censorship**: Overcome geographic restrictions imposed by governments.
- **Stopping Online Tracking**: Encrypt data to prevent ISPs and websites from tracking your location and metadata.
- **Accessing Private Networks**: Safely connect to private networks remotely, ensuring a barrier between public and private data.

#### Is a VPN Effective?

A reputable paid VPN service like ExpressVPN or StrongVPN is highly effective. However, free VPNs often compromise user privacy. For example, some free VPNs have been found to exploit users' devices for malicious activities or sell user data.

#### Do You Need a VPN in Hong Kong?

Yes, while Hong Kong enjoys more internet freedom than mainland China, increased surveillance and censorship pose risks. A VPN protects your privacy and ensures secure access to restricted content.

#### Do You Need a VPN in Taiwan?

Taiwan boasts unrestricted internet access. However, using a VPN is recommended when connecting to public Wi-Fi to safeguard your data.

### The Use and Benefits of Double or Multi-Hop VPNs
<a name="double-or-multi-hop-vpn-benefits"></a>

Double VPN, also known as multi-hop VPN, routes your internet connection through two or more VPN servers instead of just one. This approach enhances security and privacy but may impact connection speeds. Here are some potential benefits and use cases:

#### 1. Enhanced Privacy Protection

Using double or multi-hop VPNs makes it significantly harder to trace your online activities. When your data passes through a second VPN server, the original IP address is already masked by the first VPN server. This means even if someone intercepts and analyzes data from the second server, they can only see the IP address of the first server, not your real one.

#### 2. Prevention of Surveillance and Data Leaks

Double or multi-hop VPNs add an extra layer of security, which is especially beneficial when accessing sensitive information from insecure networks such as public Wi-Fi. Even if one VPN connection is compromised, attackers must still bypass the additional layers to access your data.

#### 3. Circumvention of Strict Network Censorship

In regions with strict network censorship, such as China or Iran, double or multi-hop VPNs can help. By setting up VPN servers in different countries or regions, you can effectively bypass geographic restrictions and censorship.

#### Considerations and Drawbacks

While double or multi-hop VPNs provide enhanced privacy and security, they come with trade-offs:
- **Reduced Speed**: The additional encryption and decryption processes may slow down your internet connection.
- **Complex Setup**: Managing multiple VPN connections can be more complex compared to a single VPN setup.
  
#### Summary

Double or multi-hop VPNs are valuable tools for users seeking additional privacy and security. However, users should weigh the potential trade-offs in performance and convenience before implementing this strategy.

### Impact of VPN on Internet Speed
<a name="impact-of-vpn-on-internet-speed"></a>

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) offers many advantages, such as enhanced security, privacy, and bypassing geographic restrictions. However, these benefits often come with a trade-off: a potential reduction in internet speed. Below is an exploration of these impacts:

#### 1. Encryption and Decryption Overheads
VPNs create an encrypted "tunnel" for routing your internet traffic through a remote server. The process of encrypting and decrypting data can introduce latency. The degree of delay depends on the quality of the VPN provider and the specific encryption protocol used.

#### 2. Geographic Location of Servers
The physical distance between you and the VPN server affects speed. Generally, the farther the server is from your location, the higher the latency. For instance, accessing content hosted in a geographically distant country might lead to slower internet speeds.

#### 3. Server Load
During peak times, VPN servers can become overloaded, causing slower connections. Premium VPN providers mitigate this by investing in additional servers and robust infrastructure to balance traffic.

#### 4. Baseline Internet Speed
It's essential to note that a VPN cannot exceed the original speed of your internet connection. If your connection is already slow, using a VPN may exacerbate performance issues.

In summary, while VPNs can impact internet speed, the extent of this effect depends on various factors. Opting for a high-quality VPN provider can significantly minimize these impacts.

### Differences Between VPN and Tor and Their Use Cases
<a name="VPN-vs-Tor"></a>

Both VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) and Tor (The Onion Router) are tools designed to enhance online privacy and security. However, they differ significantly in design, functionality, and appropriate use cases. Below is a detailed comparison of these two technologies and their ideal scenarios:

---

#### 1. **VPN: Encryption and IP Masking**

A VPN establishes an encrypted "tunnel" between your device and a remote server. Its key features and use cases include:

- **Data Encryption**:  
  VPNs encrypt your data before it leaves your device, ensuring that third parties attempting to intercept it only see encrypted content.

- **IP Address Masking**:  
  By routing your traffic through a VPN server, your real IP address is hidden, and you appear to be browsing from the server's location.

- **Bypassing Geographic Restrictions**:  
  VPNs allow you to access content restricted by location, such as region-locked streaming services, by making your traffic appear as if it's coming from the VPN server's region.

**Limitations**:  
VPN users must trust their VPN provider, as the provider can theoretically monitor their activity. Choosing a VPN with a strict no-logs policy is crucial for privacy.

---

#### 2. **Tor: Multi-Layer Encryption and Anonymity**

Tor provides heightened anonymity by routing data through multiple volunteer-operated servers (nodes) worldwide, encrypting it multiple times. Key features and use cases include:

- **Multi-Layer Encryption**:  
  Data is encrypted three times before entering the Tor network and decrypted layer by layer as it passes through three nodes (entry, middle, and exit). This process ensures robust anonymity.

- **Anonymity**:  
  No single node in the Tor network knows the complete path of your connection, making it nearly impossible for observers to trace your activities.

- **Accessing Hidden Services**:  
  Tor allows access to hidden services not available on the regular internet, often referred to as the "dark web."

**Limitations**:  
Tor is slower than VPNs because of its multi-layered encryption and routing process. Additionally, due to its association with illegal activities, Tor users may face scrutiny or false assumptions of illicit intent.
